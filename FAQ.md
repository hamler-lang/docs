TODO:

First, purerl translates PureScript to Erlang source code directly, and hamler compile source code to CoreErlang IR.

Second, we modified the CST, AST and CoreFn of PureScript to make the hamler syntax is more like Haskell.

The hamler compiler is forked from PureScript compiler 0.13.6.

TODO:

- Strict vs Lazy evaluation
- Hamler running on Erlang VM - Beam
