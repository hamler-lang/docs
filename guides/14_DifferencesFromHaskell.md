# Differences between Hamler and Haskell

**(Since the compiler is forked from purescript's, we have inherited some differences between Purescript and Haskell)**

## Module Imports / Exports

Type classes in modules must be specifically imported using the class keyword.

```haskell
module B where

import A (class Fab)
```

See: [Ref](https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Differences-from-Haskell.md)

## Types

We use explicit `forall`.

```haskell
id :: forall a. a -> a
```

## Float

There is no `Double` in Hamler, just `Float`

## List

```haskell
{- hamler     <â€“>     haskell
   []                   []
  [1,2,3]            [1,2,3]
  [1|[2|[3|[]]]]     1:2:3:[]

Only in hamler [1,2,3|[2,3|[1,2]]]  --[1,2,3,2,3,1,2]
-}
```

## Records

```haskell
 data Person = Person { name :: String , age :: Integer }
 p = Person {name = "alice", age = 30} --create a new record
 n = p.name        -- access record field
 a = p.age
 np = p {age = 31} --new record
```

## Deriving

Same with PureScript, Hamler doesn't have `deriving` functionality when `declaring` data types.

For example, the following code will not work

```haskell
 data Foo = Foo Int String deriving (Eq, Ord)
```

[Ref](https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Differences-from-Haskell.md)

## Orphan Instances

Hamler do not allow orphan instance.

## Operators

### No `,` operator

### No `>>`  operator

We prefer not to add (>>) for now, because the key word >> is reserved for binary syntax. We choose not to put a lot of operators for now. If there are needs, defining your own operator is allowed.

### Define Operators

In you can define a operator like this in Haskell, but this is not allowed.

```haskell
f $ x = f x  -- Not Okay

-- This is the way to do it
apply f x = f
x infixr 0 apply as $
```
## More

### No `undefined`
